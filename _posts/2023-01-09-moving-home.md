## Moving Home

For years (apart from last year) I have been using Blogger to blog my thoughts, ideas and projects.  

In that past year I have been using *Markdown* more and more so I wanted to move to a site where I could write in *Markdown* and just publish knowing what the output would look like. That's how I have ended up here.  
I also have a couple of repos here on **Github** one of which I hope to update soon.  

For now, and while I get used to my new home my posts will be sporadic.
